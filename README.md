### 1) Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Vehicle Weight (0.0776)
- Spoiler Angle (0.3069)
- AWD (0.1852)
### 2) Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is less than 0.05.
### 3) Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- The R-squared value is 0.7149. That means the model would predict the mpg of the MechaCar correctly 71% of the time. This means that the             model would be considered effective.
